 In `Emoj-it` you have to use conceptual thinking to identify famous books and movies by decoding their title written in emojis. Why emojis? Because the wide
 variety of emojis available can be an excellent means to challenge our conceptual skills and to improve our abilty to develop creative thinking. You can choose
 between movies and books, with increasing difficulty levels. There are also special sections for children since young people generally excel in conceptual thinking
 and are capable of going beyond the literal meaning of words easily. If you are struggling you can get a hint to help you identify the correct title or you can choose to see
 the solution and complete the level to access some details about that movie or book.
 
 The project has been developed in `SwiftUI`.
